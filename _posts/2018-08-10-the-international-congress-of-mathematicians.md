In the past few days, I had the chance to participate as a selected volunteer in the 2018 edition of the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians) (ICM). The ICM stands as the world's largest conference dedicated to Mathematics, taking place every four years and managed by the [International Mathematical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union) (IMU). This edition—the first-ever to happen in a Latin American country—was made possible through the efforts of the [Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Nacional_de_Matem%C3%A1tica_Pura_e_Aplicada) (IMPA).

I was there for all nine days (August 1st to 9th) of the event. My main role was administrative in nature. I was responsible for maintaining spreadsheets to track the materials handed out to hundreds of volunteers (transportation vouchers, meals, uniforms etc.) needed for later accounting. I also worked some days as a "May I Help You?" assistant, guiding attendees, helping with transfers from the airport to hotels, managing school visits, and organizing the award ceremony for the [Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad of Public Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olimp%C3%ADada_Brasileira_de_Matem%C3%A1tica_das_Escolas_P%C3%BAblicas) (OBMEP) winners.

During my free time I got to attend various talks, notably [Cédric Villani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Villani)'s Public Lecture, "[*The age of the Earth: when the Earth was too young for Darwin*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObSv67R-uyg)", [Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah)'s Abel Lecture, "[*The Future of Mathematical Physics: new ideas in old bottles*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUEvTymjpds)", and [Sanjeev Arora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjeev_Arora)'s Plenary Lecture, "[*The mathematics of machine learning and deep learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Sofj_puQ)".

I also contributed to an IMPA press [article](https://impa.br/noticias/voluntariado-dentro-e-fora-do-riocentro/) about the congress.

This is me with [Akshay Venkatesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshay_Venkatesh) during the congress. Venkatesh was one of the 2018 [Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal) medalists, awarded for his synthesis of analytic number theory, homogeneous dynamics, topology, and representation theory, which has resolved long-standing problems in areas such as the equidistribution of arithmetic objects.

Venkatesh boasts an incredible track record: he turned 13 just before entering the University of Western Australia as its youngest ever student. He completed the four-year course in three years and became, at 16, the youngest person to earn First Class Honours in pure mathematics from the university. He commenced his PhD at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") in 1998, which he completed in 2002. Today he is a professor at the School of Mathematics at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study).

In this register I hold the book [*Men of Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_of_Mathematics), by [Eric Temple Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Temple_Bell), which I was reading at the time.[^1] Pointing to the book, I asked Venkatesh: "*How do you feel now, being one of them?*". The reaction is exactly what you see in the photo.

If you want to learn more about Venkatesh's story and his contributions to mathematics, I highly recommend the excellent profile "[*A Number Theorist Who Bridges Math and Time*](https://www.quantamagazine.org/fields-medalist-akshay-venkatesh-bridges-math-and-time-20180801/)" written by Erica Klarreich for [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/).

[^1]: Yes, I am aware of all the criticisms surrounding this book and I agree with many of them. But who cares about that? A book that motivated [John Forbes Nash Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.) to become a mathematician doesn't need to satisfy anyone else to prove itself a good book.
