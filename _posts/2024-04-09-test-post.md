Hello world! This is a test post. Here's some math. The GMM estimator is defined as

$$\hat{\theta} \equiv \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} Q_n(\theta) \equiv \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \bar{g}(\theta, w)'W\bar{g}(\theta, w),$$

where $\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is the permissible parameter space, $w$ is a vector of observable data, $\bar{g}(\theta)$ is a $K \times 1$ vector of sample moment functions, and $W$ is some PSD weighting matrix. Here, we define the vector of moment functions as 

$$\bar{g}(\theta) \equiv \begin{bmatrix} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n g_1(\theta, w_i) \\
n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^ng_2(\theta, w_i) \\
\vdots \\ 
n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n g_K(\theta, w_i)
\end{bmatrix}.$$

Neat! Now, let's see how lists behave. First, an unordered list. 

- 1,
- 2...
- and 3!

Now, an ordered list.

1. A,
2. B,
3. and C!

Cool. What about block quotes? Well... 

> Cogito, ergo sum.

This is beautiful. We also like codes, so here's some code: 

```
const ultimateTruth = 'this theme is the best!';

console.log(ultimateTruth);
```

And some `inline code`!

A table:

|  AAA   | BBB |  CCC   |  DDD  |
| :----: | :-: | :----: | :---: |
| Here's |  a  | table! | Cool! |

Obsidian can help with alignment (right-click on the table).
