title: Le Cam's Nine Principles
category: statistics
---
In a rather funny article criticizing the maximum likelihood *principle*, [Lucien Le Cam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Le_Cam) outlined nine principles.

**Basic Principle 0.** Do not trust any principle. 

This applies in particular to the principles and recommendations listed below and should be kept in mind any time one encounters a problem worth studying. Anyway, here are some other principles. 

**Principle 1.** Have clear in your mind what it is that you want to estimate. 

**Principle 2.** Try to ascertain in some way what precision you need (or can get) and what you are going to do with the estimate when you get it. 

**Principle 3.** Before venturing an estimate, check that the rationale which led you to it is compatible with the data you have. 

**Principle 4.** If satisfied that everything is in order, try first a crude but reliable procedure to locate the general area in which your parameters lie. 

**Principle 5.** Having localized yourself by (4), refine the estimate using some of your theoretical assumptions, being careful all the while not to undo what you did in (4). 

**Principle 6.** Never trust an estimate which is thrown out of whack if you suppress a single observation. 

**Principle 7.** If you need to use asymptotic arguments, do not forget to let your number of observations tend to infinity. 

**Principle 8.** [Joseph Bertrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bertrand) said it this way: "Give me four parameters and I shall describe an elephant; with five, it will wave its trunk"[^1]
